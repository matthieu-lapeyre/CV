    abstract = {{In this paper we will present two humanoid platforms (Acroban and Poppy) developed in our lab to study biped locomotion and physical interaction. We will present how their morphologies (compliance, vertebral column, and soft ma- terials) produce human-like movements and natural responses to external perturbations. We will illustrate this behavior with the example of the socially guided biped locomotion. We will also discuss the very positive emotional reactions aroused when presenting Acroban to the general public. We will hypothesize that this behavior could be explained by the contrast between its crude visual appearance and its smooth and compliant movements which increases the impression of like-likeliness.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of the role of the morphology in the Poppy humanoid platform. More precisely, we have investigated the impact of the bio-inspired thigh, bended of 6\degre, on the balance and biped locomotion. We compare this design with a more traditional straight thigh. We describe both the theoretical model and real experiments showing that the bio-inspired thigh allows the reduction of falling speed by almost 60\\% (single support phase) and the decrease of the lateral motion needed for the mass transfer from one foot to the other by 30\\% (double support phase). We also present an experiment where the robot walks on a treadmill thanks to the social and physical guidance of expert users and we show that the bended thigh reduces the upper body motion by about 45\\% indicating a more stable walk.}},
